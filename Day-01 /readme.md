## ✅ Today's Learning Overview

I officially began my journey into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning today. The focus was on understanding the **theory** behind ML and building my **first practical models**.

## 🤖 What is AI & ML?

- **AI (Artificial Intelligence):** Building smart systems that simulate human intelligence.
- **ML (Machine Learning):** A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve over time.

## 🔍 Types of Machine Learning

| Type                   | Description                                       | Examples                          |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Supervised Learning**| Trained on labeled data (input + output)          | Spam detection, stock prediction |
| **Unsupervised Learning**| Learns from unlabeled data                     | Customer segmentation             |
| **Reinforcement Learning**| Learns via rewards and penalties              | Game AI, robotics                 |

## 📘 Deep Dive: Supervised Learning

I explored **Supervised Learning** in detail, which is all about learning from data that has both **inputs and correct outputs**.

Two major tasks:
- **Regression** – Predicting continuous values (e.g., prices, scores)
- **Classification** – Predicting categories or classes (e.g., pass/fail, spam/ham)

## 🤖 Practical Work

### 🏠 Model 1: Linear Regression – House Price Prediction  
Built a model to predict house prices based on square footage.  
Learned how a linear model fits data and predicts new outcomes.

---

### 📚 Model 2: Linear Regression – Student Score Prediction  
Predicted exam scores based on hours studied.  
Also visualized the data and regression line using Matplotlib.

---

### 🎓 Model 3: Logistic Regression – Pass or Fail Classification  
Built a binary classification model to predict whether a student passed or failed based on their exam score.  
Also explored probability prediction and visualized the sigmoid curve.

## 📘 Key Concepts Learned

- AI vs ML
- 3 types of ML
- What is Supervised Learning?
- Regression vs Classification
- Overfitting vs Underfitting
- Trained 2 regression models and 1 classification model using `scikit-learn`
- Visualized predictions and learned decision boundaries

## 📝 Reflection

> 🚀 Day 1 was exciting! I now understand how machines learn using labeled data and have already trained my first ML models. The real magic lies in the simplicity of the learning process. Looking forward to expanding into unsupervised learning next!
